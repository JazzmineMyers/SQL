#In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding NASA astronaut data to answer questions about the data. 

#1. What was the graduate major of all female astronauts with a military rank of Colonel?
SELECT name, Graduate_Major 
FROM astronauts 
WHERE Military_Rank = "Colonel" 
AND Gender = "Female";

#2. What are the genders of all astronauts who had a graduate or undergraduate major of Mathematics?
SELECT name, gender 
FROM astronauts 
WHERE graduate_major = "Mathematics" 
OR Undergraduate_Major = "Mathematics";

#3. What female astronauts had space flight hours greater than or equal to 2575 hours? How many space flights did they have? How many space walks?
SELECT name, gender, Space_Flights, Space_Flight_hr, Space_Walks 
FROM astronauts 
WHERE gender = "Female" 
GROUP BY name 
HAVING Space_Flight_hr >= 2575;

#4. Which female astronauts have at least three space walks?
SELECT name, gender, space_flights, space_flight_hr, space_walks 
FROM astronauts 
WHERE gender = "Female" 
GROUP BY name 
HAVING space_walks >=3;

#5. How many female astronauts have a graduate major in Physics, Chemistry, or Engineering?
SELECT name, graduate_major 
FROM astronauts 
WHERE graduate_major IN ('Physics', 'Chemistry', 'Engineering') 
AND Gender = 'Female';

#6 How many astronauts graduated MIT or have an undergraduate major in Economics?
SELECT name, gender, Alma_Mater, Undergraduate_Major 
FROM astronauts 
WHERE Alma_Mater IN ('MIT') 
OR Undergraduate_Major IN ('Economics');

#7. Show completed space walks for all female astronauts.
SELECT name, alma_mater, gender, 
CASE 
WHEN space_flights = 0 THEN 'None' 
WHEN space_flights <=1 THEN 'Few' 
WHEN space_flights <=3 THEN 'Some' 
ELSE 'Many' 
END AS Space_Walks_Completed 
FROM astronauts 
WHERE gender = 'Female';

#8. Show completed space flight hours for all astronauts who graduated from Stanford University.
SELECT name, space_flight_hr, 
CASE 
WHEN space_flight_hr = 0 THEN 'None' 
WHEN space_flight_hr <= 500 THEN 'Few' 
WHEN space_flight_hr <=1000 THEN 'Some' 
ELSE 'Many' 
END AS Space_Flights_Hour_Completed 
FROM astronauts 
WHERE alma_mater = 'Stanford University';

#9. What are the top 10 alma maters for average space flight hours?
SELECT alma_mater, AVG(space_flight_hr)
FROM astronauts 
GROUP BY alma_mater
ORDER BY AVG(space_flight_hr) DESC LIMIT 10;
